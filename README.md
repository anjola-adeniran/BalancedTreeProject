                                                 Balanced Tree Clothing Company Sales Analysis

Welcome to the Balanced Tree Clothing Company's SQL case study! In this project, we will help the company's merchandising teams analyze their sales performance and generate a basic financial report to share with the wider business. Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

                                                 Datasets
There are 4 datasets available for this case study. However, to answer the regular questions, we will only utilize 2 main tables. The additional 2 tables are used for the bonus challenge question.

                                          Key Business Questions
Below are the key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports. Each question can be answered using a single query. As we write SQL to solve each problem, we'll consider how to generate all these metrics in a single SQL script, which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

                                                         High Level Sales Analysis

What is the average discount value per transaction?
What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs. non-members?

What is the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a single transaction?
We hope this SQL case study will provide valuable insights for the Balanced Tree team and support their decision-making process. Happy analyzing!
